    "# SpeX Merging Orders Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Last updated: November 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to merge multi-order spectra from SpeX observations into a single, continuous spectrum. This is particularly useful for SXD and LXD modes where the spectrum is split across multiple echelle orders that overlap in wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When observing with SpeX in cross-dispersed modes (SXD, LXD), the spectrum is recorded in multiple echelle orders. Each order covers a different wavelength range, with some overlap between adjacent orders. The `merge` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loads a multi-order spectrum from a FITS file\n",
    "2. Identifies overlapping wavelength regions between orders\n",
    "3. Optimally combines the overlapping regions based on signal-to-noise\n",
    "4. Creates a single, continuous spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use merging\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SXD mode**: 6-7 orders covering ~0.8-2.4 \u00b5m\n",
    "- **LXD mode**: Multiple orders covering ~2.2-5.5 \u00b5m\n",
    "- After combining and telluric correction\n",
    "- When you need a single continuous spectrum for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import packages and set up paths\n",
    "2. Load a telluric-corrected multi-order spectrum  \n",
    "3. Merge the orders into a single spectrum\n",
    "4. Visualize the merged spectrum\n"
